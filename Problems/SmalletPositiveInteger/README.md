> This is a demo task.
>
> Write a function:
>     class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
> that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
>
> For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
>
> Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
> Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
>
> Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
>  * N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
>  * each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

>
> 41. First Missing Positive
>
> Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.
> You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.
>
> Example 1:
> Input: nums = [1,2,0]
> Output: 3
>
> Example 2:
> Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
> Output: 2
>
> Example 3:
> Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
> Output: 1
>
> Constraints:
>  * 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105
>  * -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
